Exactly 1 year ago I launched the [FrameOS Nim rewrite](https://frameos.net/blog/nim-rewrite).

It was a great milestone, despite the early days. The following year brought many quality of life improvements - multiple scenes, external control, iCal support, state and data nodes, rich text, caching, timezones and a FastAPI backend rewrite - [a lot of core features](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos/issues/1) were added.

The [FrameOS Home Assistant Addon](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos-home-assistant-addon) is now ready. It makes installing FrameOS easier than ever before.

I also spent a lot of time 3D printing this year. After many prototypes, the build guide for the 12.48" 3-color e-paper [display from WaveShare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/12.48inch-e-paper-module-b.htm) is finally here in the form of a YouTube video:

You can find the case itself [on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1134964-waveshare-1248-e-paper-frame).

What's in store for 2025 for FrameOS? You'll have to wait and see. The overall goal is to improve the experience. I'd like to make it easier to share scenes between users, work on adding many new apps, and to make the entire experience one that sparks joy.
