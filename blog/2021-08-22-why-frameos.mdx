About a year ago we moved to a new house. The light-to-switch situation in the living room and hallway was unbelievably inconsistent. To fix that, I placed a little Zigbee switch behind every light switch [1], and taped Philips Hue Dimmer switches next to doors. Add a bit of software trickery, and anyone can now control all lights in the room with just one switch, provided the kids didn't run off with the remote again.

A year later, the biggest first world problem I had was losing time running around the house, closing all windows, before rushing out to pick up the kids from school. There's not a lot of crime around here, but if they get you, it's by learning your patterns of forgetfulness.

The obvious answer (amirite?) was to install a Zigbee sensor on all the windows, and a screen with a dashboard near the front door.

The sensors were cheap and easy enough (20â‚¬/pop), but what about the screen? The options were either:

- A cheap android tablet, showing a Home Assistant dashboard through an app/browser.
- A small Raspberry Pi with HDMI output, or some other type of LCD display.
- A small Raspberry Pi with an e-ink display.
- Root a Kindle and stick it on a wall

Turns out humanity's made great progress over the last few years, and there are numerous cheap(ish) e-ink displays now on the market.

Combine this with a 3d-printed frame, and







[1] I went with the Aqara T1-s over the Sonoff ones since they have an external antenna (read: actually work), and support multiple physical light switches controlling the same light.
