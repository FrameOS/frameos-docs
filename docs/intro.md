# FrameOS 

FrameOS is a conductor of Raspberry Pi-powered e-ink displays and LCD screens. To get started

- Read the **[device guides](/devices)** - getting started guides, links to 3d-printable models and other resources for each supported display.
- Install the **[FrameOS controller](/installation/controller)** - a self-hosted python app that lets you build and deploy software onto individual frames via SSH.
- Set up the SD card for the [Raspberry Pi](/installation/raspberry) that'll be used in the frame.
- Finally, deploy [apps](/apps) onto your frames, or design your own.

## Status

FrameOS is currently in beta. Things are broken, and breaking changes happen all the time. It is not yet ready for production use.

If you're the adventurous type, please do try it out, and help out. We're missing all sorts of apps and overlays for example.
