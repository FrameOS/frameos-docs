# FrameOS 

![FrameOS backend](./guide/_img2/frameos-backend.gif)

### An operating system for <u>single function smart frames</u>. 

It's designed for both screens that update **60 frames per second**, and for screens that update **60 seconds per frame**.
Think smart home calendars, meeting room displays, thermostats, interactive message boards, public advertisement screens, and more. 

FrameOS is written in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/), and gets compiled into a single binary when deployed.

### What do you need?

- A Raspberry Pi. Any will do. The [Zero W 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) hits the sweet spot for eink displays (small, cheap, multicore), and can easily do 24 FPS on small LCDs. To get 60FPS over HDMI you'll need a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/).
- A display of some sort. E-ink or LCD. Take your pick from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1.htm) or 
[Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/displays)'s e-ink HATs, or hook up a TV with an HDMI cable. 
- A server for hosting the FrameOS backend. You'll use this to deploy scenes onto frames via SSH. 

[Read the guide](/guide/backend) to get started.

### Prebuilt scenes

Deploy your first scene from the list of prebuilt templates:

![Scenes](./_img/sample-scenes.png)

### Create your own scenes

Visually connect apps like "Render Text" and "OpenAI Image" to build your own scenes. 
Make those scenes externally controllable with a QR code at the corner of the screen.

Go a step deeper, fork the prebuilt apps, and build new ones from scratch:

## Getting started

1. Start by installing the [FrameOS backend](/guide/backend).
2. Then set up [the raspberry](/guide/raspberry), while following the [device guide](/devices) for your specific screen.
3. Finally, read the [rest of the guide](/guide/using) to learn how to build your own apps.

## Status

FrameOS is good enough for small-time usage. Most of the core concepts are in place.

We haven't released a numbered version yet. A `FrameOS/frameos:latest` docker image is generated for every push to `main`. While we take great care not to break things, there are no guarantees at this point.

If you're the adventurous type, please try it out, and help out. Look at [the tasklist](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos/issues/1) for ideas. Don't ask for permission, just submit a PR. If you're not sure, open an issue and we'll discuss it.

## Next steps:
