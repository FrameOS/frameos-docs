# FrameOS


### An operating system for <u>single function smart frames</u>. 

It's designed for both screens that update **60 frames per second**, and for screens that update **60 seconds per frame**.
Think smart home calendars, meeting room displays, thermostats, interactive message boards, public advertisement screens, and more. 

FrameOS is written in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/), and gets compiled into a single binary when deployed. Everything runs locally on device, 
there is no cloud to subscribe to.

### FrameOS backend

You use the backend to deploy _FrameOS_ onto _frames_.

It can be installed as a **[Home Assistant Addon](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos-home-assistant-addon)** 
or as a standalone docker app with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://frameos.net/install.sh | bash
```

Here's what it looks like:

### What do you need to get started?

- Someplace to run the FrameOS backend. Run it locally or on a server. It'll connect to the frames with SSH.
- A display of some sort. E-ink or LCD. Take your pick from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1.htm) or
[Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/displays)'s e-ink HATs, or hook up a TV with an HDMI cable.
- A Raspberry Pi with a stock Raspberry Pi OS Lite installed.
  - For maximum peformance, (e.g. 60FPS over HDMI) you'll need a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/).
  - If size matters, use the [Zero W 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/). It's great for eink displays, and can even do 24 FPS on small LCDs.


### Sample frames

Here are some frames I have around the house.

### Sample scenes

Deploy your first scene from [the repository](https://repo.frameos.net/).

### Scene editor

Create new scenes using the diagram editor.

### App editor

Go even deeper and edit the source behind each app on the scene

## Getting started

1. Start by installing the [FrameOS backend](/guide/backend). `curl -fsSL https://frameos.net/install.sh | bash`
2. Then set up [the raspberry](/guide/raspberry), while following the [device guide](/devices) for your specific screen.
3. Finally, read the [rest of the guide](/guide/first-deploy) to learn how to build your own scenes.

## Status

FrameOS is good enough for small-time usage. Most of the core concepts are in place.

There is no numbered release yet. A `FrameOS/frameos:latest` docker image is generated for every push to `main`. While we take great care not to break things, there are no guarantees at this point.

If you're the adventurous type, please try it out, and help out. Look at [the tasklist](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos/issues/1) for ideas. Don't ask for permission, just submit a PR. If you're not sure, open an issue and we'll discuss it.
