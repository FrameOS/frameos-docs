## What to buy?

- The [HyperPixel 2.1" Round 480x480 LCD with touch](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-round?variant=39381081882707) display directly from Pimoroni.
- [A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://amzn.to/461s8Iv) (preferred) or [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://amzn.to/462NvJj) (slower)
- Normally you would buy a 40-pin GPIO header (here's a [pack of 10](https://amzn.to/3Pf4vWc)) and solder it to the raspberry. However you can also buy the pre-pinned [Raspberry Pi Zero WH](https://amzn.to/3PeIaYC) if you don't need the extra speed, and don't want to solder.


## Installation steps

- Install the second-latest Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye), not the old old one (Buster) as written in [Pimoroni's docs](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-round?variant=39381081882707), and not the new one (Bookworm). 
- We're only writing to the framebuffer, and not using the slightly broken GPU acceleration (works in Buster), so the OS version doesn't matter. However I didn't get the latest (Bookworm) working yet.
- Bullseye comes with Python 3.9, but FrameOS requires 3.11. Do the [required upgrade](https://www.google.com/search?q=debian+bullseye+python+3.11).

- SSH in and run the following to install the pimoroni software and activate the display:
```shell
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel2r
cd hyperpixel2r
sudo ./install.sh
# remove 3d acceleration
sudo sed -i '/dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d/s/^/#/' /boot/config.txt
sudo reboot
```
- When you reboot, the screen should show a Linux startup screen. 
- Set up the frame in the FrameOS controller. Select the **Pimoroni HyperPixel 2.1 Round** driver.

## 3D models

- This is the [case I printed](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/enclosure-m3-for-pimoroni-hyperpixel-2-1-round-touch-and-raspberry-pi-zeer.imaero)

## Brightness control

Within your apps, run

```python
# Turn the display on
self.app_handler.image_handler.display_on()

# Turn the display off
self.app_handler.image_handler.display_off()
```

To control the brightness from the command line, run

```shell
sudo apt install wiringpi
# Set the pin to PWM mode
gpio -g mode 19 pwm 
# Set the value/brightness to 60
gpio -g pwm 19 60
# Value Effect
# 0 - 24 Backlight off
# 25 - 90 Various degrees of brightness
# 91 - 1023 Full brightness
```
Both the hyperpixel and the hyperpixel4 use pin 19 (BCM) ([source](https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel/issues/11#issuecomment-437573404), [inspiration](https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel2r/blob/master/dist/hyperpixel2r-init)).
