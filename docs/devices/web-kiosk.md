# HDMI & Web Kiosk

## HDMI

The HDMI output passes the generated image onto the framebuffer. It's a crude approach, and useful for testing, or when your image doesn't require 60fps interactivity.

## Web Kiosk

Each deployed frame comes with Kiosk mode. Click the Kiosk URL under the frame's settings to see the displayed image in a browser.
